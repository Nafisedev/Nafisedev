## The Data Science Course 2022: Complete Data Science Bootcamp - Udemy course
###### Mar 2022 - present

In this course, I saw the applications of complex mathematical theory to process and aggregate data. So far, I have gone in-depth with programming and theoretical concepts, but this course covers more deeply the intersection of both.

## The Complete Python 3 Course: Beginner to Advanced - Udemy course  
###### Sep 2021 - Feb 2022

Worked on the more practical application of Python. For example, I created a python game where you battle against opponents, where the last one standing wins. There is also added complexity with abilities. I also made a blog using Django and learned more about using git and version control as part of this course.

## Python Bootcamp: Bringing ML models into production - Udemy course  
###### Jun 2021 - Aug 2021

Using ML algorithms in a real-world problem was a great inspiration. We created a project about working on power supplier data using Azure ML services for future energy generation, storage, and consumption analysis.

## Python for Data Analysis, 2nd Edition - Book  
###### Nov 2020 - April 2021

I read this book to learn about applying Python data science libraries with  Jupyter Notebook. The book had labs in every chapter and ended with exploring real-world datasets where we learned to look at the data. An example of the datasets is looking at baby names based on birth statistics provided by the United States Social Security Administration (SSA) from 1880 to 2010.

## The Data Science Workshop  
###### Mar 2020 - Oct 2020

The workshop allowed me to apply my knowledge in real-world applications with current technologies. I used Google Colab to learn the application of machine learning algorithms with Python libraries.

## The Hitchhikerâ€™s Guide to AI & ML in AWS - Workshop  
###### Jan 2020

I enjoyed learning about data collection and prep. and the practical work with AWS Sagemaker. We practiced on datasets to classify images of handwritten digits, from zero to nine.
